## What is QuantOS?

QuantOS is a complete career preparation platform for students who want to break into quantitative finance — as researchers, traders, developers, or risk quants — without paying for expensive prep courses or subscriptions.

Built by a student, for students who can't afford the alternatives.

**Everything is free. Everything runs locally. Your data never leaves your browser.**

## Running Locally

**Zero install — open in Claude.ai artifacts:**
Drop `QuantOS_v1_20.jsx` into claude.ai → it runs instantly.

**Local dev with hot-reload:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/quantos
cd quantos
npm create vite@latest . -- --template react
# Replace src/App.jsx content with QuantOS_v1_20.jsx content
npm install && npm run dev
```

## AI Features Setup

AI powers interview practice, the career advisor, competition search, and networking discovery.  
**You supply your own key — it lives only on your device, never on any server.**

**Recommended free option (Groq):**
1. Go to [console.groq.com/keys](https://console.groq.com/keys)
2. Create a free account → generate key
3. In QuantOS → click ⚙ in sidebar → paste key → Save

Free Groq tier: **14,400 requests/day** — ample for daily use.

Supported providers: Groq · Google Gemini · Mistral · Anthropic

## Data & Privacy

- All progress, notes, and settings stored in browser `localStorage`
- No data sent to any server (except your chosen AI provider during AI calls)
- Clearing browser data resets the app — export first
- No analytics, no tracking, no cookies, no ads
